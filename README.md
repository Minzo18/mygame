![Prize](https://github.com/Minzo18/mygame/blob/master/prize.jpg)

The game starts with the players on the left side of the screen and the enemies and the prize on the right side moving towards the left side at random speeds. When the enemies and the prize hit the boundary wall on the left, they will move in the opposite direction at a different speed. To make it more challenging, their vertical postions will also change.

The player is able to move left, right, up and down using the directional buttons on the keyboard.

The goal of this game is to catch the prize without colliding with any of the enemies.

If the player catches the prize, they win.

If the player collides with an enemy, they lose.
